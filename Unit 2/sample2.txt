How the two-rotor Enigma machine works: Rotors 1 (the inner wheel) and 2 (the middle wheel) can rotate clockwise, while the backplate (the outer wheel) is stationary. The numbers around the backplate indicate positions. To encrypt a character, call it the input character, using this machine, locate the input character on rotor 1. Next, identify the character on the backplate at the same position. Let's call this the backplate character. Now locate the backplate character on rotor 2. The encryption of the input character is the character on the backplate at the same position as the backplate character's position on rotor 2. When rotor 1 completes a full revolution by returning to its original positioning, rotor 2 advances one position in the clockwise direction. This is similar to how the minutes and hours advance on a clock.
