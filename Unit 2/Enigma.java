General approach:
I started by practicing encrypting different messages with the enigma machine
on paper so I could develop the right method of how to approach programming it.
I realized rather quickly that programming it was fairly straightforward and
similar to how you would do it on paper. I then started with the initializeRotors.
the trickiest part was figuring out the math to rotate the rotors. I realized that
you would have to rotate the rotors to the left in order to initialize them, hence
forming the -(s1-32) equation. I tested this and it seemed to work well.
Then I wrote the advanceRotor. Unbeknownst to me, this function was going to be the
ultimate cause of my program not working. I had initially written it so that the
rotors would rotate counter-clockwise instead of clockwise, which was a huge mistake
and the reason why my program was not working initially.
Writing the encrypt was fairly straightforward and I just followed the steps
that a human would take to use enigma machine encryption. Then I tested, and found
that the program would encrypt the first character correctly, and each subsequent character
would be off by a consistent interval of 2 + the previous offset. So the first character
was correct, the second character was 2 ascii values off, the third was 4 ascii values off,
and this would continue until the ascii was 126 or above and wrap around back to 32.
At first I thought my encrypt was wrong, so I consulted my classmates who told me that
my encryption looked exactly like theirs. After a short break, I came back and realized
that I ahd been rotating the rotors the wrong way the whole time!! After I fixed this,
my encryption worked perfectly. I then proceeded to write my decrypt, first starting by
writing out the steps on paper for how I would execute it manually, and then translating
it into code, which worked.

I guess the main lesson for me was to take a break if I'm getting confused or lost, a
fresh mind helps with seeing a problem from a new perspective!! :)
